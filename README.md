### Notes:
- This implementation allows floor numbers from 0 to int.MaxValue.
- It is a console app that depends on user input, and output is also via the Console.
- Repeated floors are allowed (...9,5,5,6...), with 0 travel time registered.
- This project is built and run using Microsoft VS Code, using the 'C# Dev Kit' extension.
- Microsoft assures me that VS code will run in a Linux environment -- I have not tested it there.
