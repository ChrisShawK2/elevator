### Notes:
- This implementation allows floor numbers from 0 to *int.MaxValue*.
- It is a Console app that reads on user input from the Console.  Output is also via the Console.
- Repeated floors are allowed (...9,5,5,6...), with 0 travel time registered.
- This project is built and run using Microsoft VS Code, using the 'C# Dev Kit' extension.
- Microsoft assures me that VS code will run in a Linux environment -- I have not tested it there.
- In the *...bin/Debug/net9.0/* folder is an executable (*Elevator.exe*) that runs on Windows
